Provisioning the PolyLogyx Client for Endpoints
================================================

The PolyLogyx client that is a part of the PolyLogyx endpoint platform,
leverages osquery, a multi-platform operating system monitoring and
instrumentation framework. Typically, deploying osquery and running it across
your fleet can be a daunting and complicated task. Using CPT makes it easy to
deploy and communicate with management server. Here are the features the
PolyLogyx client offers:

-   Compliance (PCI, HIPAA)

-   Digital forensics

-   Asset and inventory use cases

-   Vulnerability management

-   Host intrusion detection

-   Performance and operational troubleshooting

Installing the PolyLogyx Client 
--------------------------------

Installing the PolyLogyx client involves these steps:

1.  Complete the needed prerequisites. See [Before you
    Begin](#before-you-begin-1) for more information.

2.  Deploy the client. See [Deploying the PolyLogyx
    Client](#deploying-the-polylogyx-client) for more information.

3.  Verify if the installation was successful. See [Verifying Client
    Installation](#verifying-client-installation) for more information.

### Before you Begin

Before you begin installation, ensure you complete the following prerequisites.

-   Provision a PolyLogyx server using a docker image. For more information, see
    [Provisioning the PolyLogyx Server](#getting-started).

-   Ensure you have working knowledge of osquery. If not, please read about
    [osquery](https://osquery.io/).

-   Make sure the endpoints meet the following system requirements.

    -   Support 64-bit architecture

    -   Have Windows 7 or later operating system installed

    -   Do not have these installed:

        -   osquery

        -   older version of PolyLogyx client

    -   Do not have host-based firewalls or other security tools that might
        interfere with a remote installation

    -   Allow outbound TCP traffic on port 9000

-   Procure the needed software by downloading the following from the [PolyLogyx
    site](https://polylogyx.com/download).

    -   CPT utility

    -   Public key file

### Deploying the PolyLogyx Client

Use the PolyLogyx Client Provisioning Tool (CPT) utility to deploy the PolyLogyx
client on endpoints. After you identify endpoints on which to deploy the client,
push the CPT utility and public key file to the endpoints using any standard
mechanism, such as SCCM.

Initiate a remote session and run the installation command remotely (using
PSEXEC or WMIC command line utilities) with administrative privileges.

Here is the syntax to execute the installation command.

```plgx_cpt.exe -i <ip address> -h <hostname> -k <server's public key file> [-p <port number>] [-v <osquery version>] [-o <download directory>]```

Here is the syntax description.

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \-i or -h | Specify one of the following. This is a required parameter. -i represents the IP address of the PolyLogyx management server (x.x.x.x format). -h represents the fully qualified domain name to the management server in the format a.b.c. You don’t need to https.                                                                                                                              |
| \-k       | Indicates the full path to the server public key file. This is a required parameter.                                                                                                         |
| \-p       | Represents the server port. This is an optional parameter and defaults to 9000.                                                                                                              |
| \-v       | Represents the osquery version to be installed. Currently, only version 3.2.6 is supported. This is an optional parameter. If you do not specify a version, the latest version is installed. |
| \-o       | Indicates the location at which to download. The default value is c:\\plgx-temp\\. This is an optional parameter.                                                                            |

Here is an example of a remote command execution using PSEXEC.

```psexec \\101.101.1.101 -u Administrator cmd /c dir C:\Users\Administrator\plgx_cpt.exe -i 11.111.111.11 -k c:\certificate.crt```

The installation begins and the CPT utility brings the required artefacts on the
endpoints. After installation is complete, the Osquery 3.2.4 and PolyLogyx
extensions are deployed and the osqueryd service starts. Also, CPT is installed as a Windows service and it acts as a watcher for osqueryd service starts. If the osqueryd service stops, the CPT service restarts it. The following output is
displayed if the command is successful.

```
Downloading Files needed for install. Depending on your network connection, it might take some time. Please wait..
Osquery successfully installed.
Configuring client..Please wait..
Service stopped successfully
Osquery stopped
Client configuration..Ready to go in 5 seconds..
Service start pending...
Service started successfully.
CPT Service installed successfully
Service start pending...
Service started successfully.
=== PolyLogyx osquery client installed Successfully ===
```


### Verifying Client Installation 

After you deploy the PolyLogyx client, complete these steps to verify the
installation. When the PolyLogyx client is installed successfully, the following
processes start:

1.  osqueryd service

2.  vast service

3.  vastnw service

4.  Plgx_win_extension.exe process

Installation is not successful if any of these fail to start.

Follow these steps to check if the required processes are running.

1.  Open a command window with administrative privileges.

2.  Run the following command to check the state of software stack, including
    osquery, PolyLogyx Extension and associated services.

```plgx_cpt.exe –c```

The command output lists the current state of the osqueryd, vast, and vastnw
services.
```osqueryd service up and running
===================================================
||           Query Execution Output              ||
===================================================
name : plgx_win_extension
path : \\.\pipe\osquery.em.3694
sdk_version : 1.0.0
type : extension
uuid : 3694
version : 1.0.0

===================================================
||          Query Execution Finished             ||
===================================================

vast service up and running
vastnw service up and running  
```

1.  Review the output to verify if the required services are running.

2.  Check if the plgx_win_extension.exe process is running.

3.  Open Task Manager.

4.  Switch to the Details tab.

5.  Locate the entry for the plgx_win_extension.exe process.

6.  Verify that process status is set to Running.

Uninstalling the Client
-----------------------

Follow these steps to uninstall the PolyLogyx client.

1.  Open a command window with administrative privileges.

2.  Close any open instances of the osqueryd, vast, and vastnw services.

3.  Run the uninstall command.

    Here is the syntax to execute the installation command.

```plgx_cpt.exe -u {\<d\> full-uninstall \| \<s\> shallow-uninstall}```

The -u parameter is used to uninstall the agent and cannot be combined with any
other options. With the –u option, you must use one of these options:

| Option | Description                                                                                                                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s    | Used with the –u parameter for shallow uninstall. This option only uninstalls the software and does not delete associated data files. |
| d    | Used with the –u parameter for deep uninstall. This option removes all traces of the agent, including data files.                     |

Here are command examples.

The following output is displayed if the `plgx_cpt.exe -u d` command is successful. 
``` uninstall_osq, will remove everything osquery , db and all folders
Stopping services. Please wait for a few second. As they say, Patience is a Virtue
Services stopped successfully !!

```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Upgrading the Client 
---------------------

Follow these steps to upgrade the PolyLogyx client.

1.  Open a command window with administrative privileges.

2.  Run the upgrade command.

    Here is the syntax to execute the upgrade command.

```plgx_cpt.exe [-g {<f> <update flagsfile>} | {<x> <update extension binary alone>} | {<a> <update osquery full>} | {<o> <update osquery only without extension>} | {<c> <update cpt>]}```

The -g parameter is used to upgrade the agent and cannot be combined with any
other options. With the –g option, you must use one of these options:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| f       | Upgrades only the osquery.flags file.                                                                                                                                    |
