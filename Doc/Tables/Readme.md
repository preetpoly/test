Tables
======

The PolyLogyx Endpoint Platform leverages osquery that enables PolyLogyx to
expose the endpoint node as a relational database in the form of SQL tables.
These tables represent a breadth of system information, including running
processes, installed applications, hardware properties, and network connections.
As a result, you can run simple SQL queries to simple gain visibility for a
*point in time* view of the endpoint node.

PolyLogyx has extended and optimized osquery to support detection and response
use cases by adding new tables (see below). Where required, the tables are real
time (evented) in nature to ensure all activity is captured for analysis and
investigation.

For more information on the tables, see:
